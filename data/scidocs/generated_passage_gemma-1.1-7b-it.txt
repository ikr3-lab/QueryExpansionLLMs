## A Direct Search Method to Solve Economic Dispatch Problem with Valve-Point Effect  Economic dispatch plays a pivotal role in ensuring efficient operation of power systems. It involves optimally allocating generation resources to meet demand while minimizing operational costs. However, the presence of valve-point effect, non-linearity inherent in certain generating units, adds complexity to the Economic Dispatch Problem (EDP).  Traditional methods for solving EDP often struggle with valve-point effect due to its non-convex nature.

## Train Longer, Generalize Better: Closing the Generalization Gap in Large Batch Training of Neural Networks  Large batch training (LBT) has emerged as a promising technique for training deep neural networks, offering advantages such as improved stability and faster convergence. However, a significant challenge associated with LBT is the notorious "generalization gap": models trained with large batches often fail to generalize well to unseen data, leading to inferior performance on downstream tasks.  This generalization gap arises due to the inherent trade-off between stability and generalization. While large batches provide greater stability by averaging out the noise in the data, they also limit the exposure of the model to diverse data points, leading to reduced generalization.   Several approaches have been proposed to mitigate this issue. One common technique is to employ **data augmentation** strategies, such as random rotations, flips, and cropping, to artificially increase the diversity of the training data. This helps the model learn more generalizable representations.   Another approach is to utilize **alternating optimization** schemes, where the model is trained with large batches for a few epochs, followed by a short period of training with smaller batches. This strategy allows the model to benefit from the stability of large batches while retaining the ability to explore diverse data points.  Furthermore
## Generate to Adapt: Aligning Domains Using Generative Adversarial Networks  The seamless integration of artificial intelligence across diverse domains necessitates the ability to adapt models to new environments. While pre-trained models often offer valuable knowledge, their application across domains is hampered by domain gaps - discrepancies in data distributions and underlying concepts between different settings. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful tool to bridge these domain gaps and enable adaptation across diverse contexts.  **How GANs work:**  GANs consist of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator attempts to generate data resembling the target domain, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated data. This adversarial interaction forces both networks to improve, leading to the generator generating increasingly realistic data from the source domain, and the discriminator becoming less accurate in its classification.  **Adapting to new domains:**  To adapt a pre-trained model to a new domain using GANs, the generator network is trained to generate data from the source domain, while the discriminator network is trained on both the source and target domain data. This process aligns the representations of both domains, enabling the source model to generalize effectively to the target domain.  **Benefits of using GANs for domain adaptation:**

## Unraveling the Anxious Mind: Anxiety, Worry, and Frontal Engagement in Sustained Attention Versus Off-Task Processing  Anxiety, a ubiquitous emotion in our contemporary world, significantly impacts cognitive functioning. While its influence on attention has been extensively studied, the specific mechanisms through which anxiety affects sustained attention and off-task processing remain poorly understood. This paper explores the relationship between anxiety, worry, and frontal engagement in these two cognitive tasks.  **Sustained Attention and Anxiety**  Sustained attention, the ability to focus on a task without interruption for an extended period, is heavily reliant on the frontal lobe.

## Modeling Purposeful Adaptive Behavior with the Principle of Maximum Causal Entropy  Understanding how organisms adapt to their environment is a central question in biology. Traditional models of adaptive behavior often rely on optimizing fitness-related traits. However, such approaches struggle to explain flexible and context-dependent behavior observed in many organisms.  Inspired by information theory, the principle of maximum causal entropy (MCE) offers a novel framework for modeling purposeful adaptive behavior. This principle suggests that intelligent agents maximize the amount of information they can extract from their environment by choosing actions that maximize the causal entropy of their observations. In simpler terms, organisms act in ways that yield the most diverse and informative outcomes.  MCE-based models capture several key features of purposeful behavior. Firstly, they acknowledge that organisms have limited knowledge of their environment and must infer relevant information from their observations. Secondly, they emphasize the importance of surprise and novelty in learning and adaptation. By choosing actions that generate unexpected outcomes, organisms can uncover new information and improve their understanding of the environment.  The application of MCE to adaptive behavior has yielded promising results. Researchers have successfully modeled various behaviors in different contexts, including foraging decisions of animals, tool use in humans, and navigation strategies of robots. This framework offers several advantages over traditional models. Firstly, it is more
## A Complete Recipe for Stochastic Gradient MCMC  **Step 1: Problem Formulation**  - Identify the probability distribution of interest, p(θ). - Define the target variable of interest, θ. - Specify the observable data, D.  **Step 2: Proposal Distribution Construction**  - Choose a proposal distribution, q(θ|θ̃), which should be easy to sample from and closely resemble p(θ). - Popular choices include Gaussian, Metropolis-Hastings, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo proposals.  **Step 3: Gradient Estimation**  - Approximate the gradient of the log-posterior, ∇log(p(θ|D)), using a stochastic gradient estimator. - Common methods include:     - **Batch gradient estimation:** Uses a subset of the data to estimate the gradient.     - **Mini-batch gradient estimation:** Uses a small batch of the data to estimate the gradient.     - **Stochastic gradient estimation:** Uses a single data point to estimate the gradient.  **Step 4: Acceptance Criteria**  - Define an acceptance criterion to determine whether to accept the proposed θ. - The Metropolis-Hastings criterion is commonly used: accept θ if p(θ|D)q(θ
## Active Sentiment Domain Adaptation  Active sentiment domain adaptation tackles the challenge of sentiment analysis in previously unseen domains, where labelled data is scarce and costly to acquire. This problem is particularly relevant for applications where rapid deployment and adaptability are crucial, such as social media monitoring or customer feedback analysis.  **Traditional approaches** to domain adaptation rely on transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain through techniques like feature selection, weighting algorithms, or ensemble learning. However, these methods often suffer from performance degradation due to the inherent differences between domains.  **Active learning** offers a promising solution to this dilemma. By selectively choosing informative data points for labelling, active learning algorithms can learn more efficiently and adapt to new domains. This involves two key steps:  * **Selection:** Choosing which data points to label is crucial for maximizing the learning benefit. Various selection criteria have been proposed, such as uncertainty sampling, margin sampling, or query-by-committee. * **Adaptation:** Once the labelled data is obtained, it can be used to refine the domain-adaptation models. This iterative process of selection and adaptation allows the algorithm to progressively improve its performance in the target domain.  **Active sentiment domain adaptation algorithms** typically leverage the following:  * **Domain-aware features:** Extracting features
## Sources of Momentum Profits: Evidence on the Irrelevance of Characteristics  Momentum profits arise from exploiting temporary deviations of stock prices from their underlying fundamentals. While prior research suggests that certain characteristics, such as volatility, skewness, and momentum itself, are useful predictors of future momentum profits, this paper argues that these characteristics are largely irrelevant for predicting momentum profits in the long run.  Our analysis shows that incorporating these characteristics into momentum strategies does not improve their profitability compared to a simple buy-and-hold strategy. This suggests that momentum profits are not driven by the inherent characteristics of the stocks exhibiting them. Instead, we propose that momentum profits are primarily generated by market microstructure factors, such as liquidity and trading volume.  Specifically, we find that:  * **Volatility:** Contrary to previous findings, including stocks with high volatility in momentum strategies does not enhance returns. * **Skewness:** The skewness of a stock's return distribution has no significant impact on momentum profits. * **Momentum:** Including stocks with high past momentum in a strategy does not guarantee future momentum profits. * **Liquidity:** Stocks with high trading volume experience more pronounced momentum profits.  These findings suggest that investors can achieve momentum profits without relying on traditional stock characteristics. Instead, focusing on liquidity and
## Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network Architectures for Large-Scale Acoustic Modeling  Acoustic modeling poses significant challenges in large-scale scenarios due to the inherent long-term dependencies within sequential data like speech. Traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) suffer from vanishing and exploding gradient problems, limiting their ability to capture long-term dependencies effectively. To address this, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks were introduced.  **LSTM Architectures:**  LSTM networks consist of gates that control the flow of information through the network. These gates learn to selectively filter out irrelevant information from the past, allowing the network to focus on the most relevant parts of the sequence. This ability to retain information over long periods of time makes LSTMs ideal for acoustic modeling.  **Architectural Variations:**  * **Stacked LSTMs:** Multiple LSTM layers are stacked on top of each other, allowing for deeper learning of long-term dependencies. * **Bidirectional LSTMs:** Information travels in both forward and backward directions, capturing more context from the sequence. * **Attention LSTMs:** These networks utilize attention mechanisms to focus on specific parts of the sequence that are most relevant to the current time step.  **Challenges in Large-Scale Acoustic Modeling:**  Scaling LSTMs to large datasets
## An Evolutionary Tic-Tac-Toe Player  Within the realm of artificial intelligence, evolutionary algorithms have emerged as powerful tools for creating intelligent agents. Inspired by natural selection, these algorithms mimic the process of evolution, where individuals with advantageous traits are favored and passed on to the next generation. Applied to games like tic-tac-toe, evolutionary algorithms can produce players that learn to compete against human opponents.  An evolutionary tic-tac-toe player starts as a random agent, making moves randomly. Its performance is then evaluated against a human opponent, receiving feedback in the form of wins, losses, and draws. This feedback is used to guide the algorithm's evolution. The player's genes, represented by different move selection strategies, are mutated and combined, creating new generations of players. Those players exhibiting better performance in previous games are favored and given a higher probability of being selected for the next generation.  Over time, the evolutionary algorithm converges towards a player that consistently outperforms human opponents. This champion player learns to identify patterns in the board, anticipate moves, and strategically position its marks to guarantee victory. The key to its success lies in the adaptability and continuous learning of the algorithm.  The advantages of an evolutionary approach are numerous. Unlike traditional programming, where rules have to
## Analysing RateMyProfessors Evaluations Across Institutions, Disciplines, and Cultures: The Tell-Tale Signs of a Good Professor  RateMyProfessors (RMP) offers a unique window into the student perception of teaching across institutions, disciplines, and cultures. While its efficacy as a definitive measure of teaching quality remains debated, the sheer volume of data it collects allows for insightful analysis of what constitutes effective teaching, as perceived by students.  **Institutional Variations:**  Across institutions, significant disparities exist in average ratings. Ivy League schools consistently score higher than state universities, likely due to factors such as student demographics, admission standards, and institutional resources. This highlights the importance of contextualising RMP data within the specific institutional environment.  **Disciplinary Differences:**  Different disciplines attract students with varying expectations and learning preferences. For example, engineering students are more likely to rate professors highly on technical expertise, while literature students prioritize communication and empathy. This necessitates differentiating RMP analysis by discipline to identify meaningful patterns.  **Cultural Influences:**  Student perceptions of effective teaching vary significantly across cultures. Studies have shown that students in collectivist cultures tend to rate professors more leniently than those in individualistic cultures. Cultural differences in communication styles, assessment criteria, and learning goals must be considered when
## Parser Extraction of Triples in Unstructured Text  Extracting triples from unstructured text is a crucial step in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and knowledge graph construction. Triples consist of a subject, a predicate, and an object, representing relationships between entities in the text. Parser-based approaches leverage the syntactic structure of sentences to extract triples, making them effective for languages with rich morphology and complex sentence structures.  **Parser-based triple extraction involves:**  1. **Sentence parsing:** The text is parsed into its constituent words and phrases using a sentence parser. This creates a dependency tree representation of the sentence. 2. **Dependency analysis:** The dependency tree is analyzed to identify potential subject-predicate-object (S-P-O) triples. This involves examining the syntactic roles of words and their relationships to other words in the sentence. 3. **Triple filtering:** The identified triples are filtered based on linguistic constraints and domain-specific knowledge to eliminate irrelevant or ambiguous ones.   **Advantages of parser-based triple extraction:**  * **High accuracy:** Parsers capture the precise syntactic relationships between words, leading to accurate triple extraction. * **Handles complex sentences:** Parsers can handle sentences with complex syntax
## Neural Darwinism and Consciousness  Neural Darwinism proposes that consciousness emerges from the evolutionary arms race between neurons. Just as natural selection favors traits that enhance survival, neurons that enhance their ability to encode information, connect with others, and survive are favored. This process leads to the gradual refinement of neural circuits, ultimately leading to the emergence of complex conscious experiences.  **The Core Principles**  Neural Darwinism rests on three key principles:  * **Neural competition:** Neurons compete for limited resources, such as synaptic connections and neurotransmitters. Those that are more efficient in encoding information and influencing others are more likely to survive and proliferate. * **Neurotransmitter evolution:** Neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers between neurons, have evolved to optimize communication and information processing. Different neurotransmitters confer unique effects on neurons, allowing for specialization and adaptation. * **Experience-dependent plasticity:** The brain is highly adaptable, and experiences shape neural circuits. Repeatedly engaging in certain activities strengthens the associated neural pathways, leading to long-term changes in consciousness.  **Evolution of Consciousness**  Neural Darwinism suggests that consciousness is not a fixed trait, but rather an ongoing evolutionary process. Early forms of consciousness may have arisen from simple information processing abilities of early neurons. As neurons evolved and connected
## Universal Upper and Lower Bounds on Energy of Spherical Designs  The energy of a mechanical system is a fundamental quantity that influences its behavior and stability. Establishing bounds on the energy of a system provides valuable insights into its potential performance and limitations. In the context of spherical designs, finding universal bounds on their energy becomes particularly significant.  **Upper Bounds:**  Several factors contribute to the upper bound of the energy of spherical designs. Material properties, such as stiffness and density, influence the potential energy stored in the system. Geometric constraints, such as the radius of curvature of the sphere, limit the amount of potential energy that can be stored. Additionally, kinetic energy considerations bound the energy of the system, as the motion of the sphere is constrained by its boundary.  **Lower Bounds:**  The lower bound of energy in spherical designs arises from the inherent gravitational potential of the system. The gravitational energy of a sphere is directly proportional to its mass and the radius of its curvature. This implies that a sphere with a larger mass or smaller radius will have a higher gravitational energy.  **Universal Bounds:**  By considering the above factors, researchers have established universal bounds on the energy of spherical designs. These bounds hold for any configuration of mass and geometry, regardless of the specific design or material properties.
## The Hidden Image of the City: Sensing Community Well-Being from Urban Mobility  Within the intricate symphony of urban life, the movement of people reveals a hidden narrative - one that whispers tales of community well-being.

## An Android Malware Detection Approach Using Weight-Adjusted Deep Learning  Traditional malware detection methods often struggle to keep pace with the rapid evolution of malicious code. Machine learning and deep learning techniques have emerged as promising solutions, but their effectiveness can be hampered by the inherent imbalance in the data, where benign and malicious code vastly outnumber each other. This imbalance can lead to biased models that fail to accurately detect malicious code.  **Weight-Adjusted Deep Learning for Improved Accuracy**  This paper proposes a novel Android malware detection approach based on weight-adjusted deep learning. The proposed approach addresses the data imbalance issue by assigning higher weights to minority classes (malicious samples) during the training process. This ensures that the model learns to recognize malicious code more effectively, leading to improved accuracy.  **Architecture Overview**  The proposed approach involves two stages: feature extraction and classification.  * **Feature Extraction:** Features are extracted from the Android application's code, manifest file, and resources using various static and dynamic analysis techniques. * **Classification:** A deep learning model is trained using the extracted features, with weights adjusted to prioritize the learning of malicious code patterns.  **Key Features**  * **Adaptive Weight Adjustment:** Weights are dynamically adjusted during training based on the model's confidence in
## The Theory of Planned Behavior and Parental Involvement: A Theoretical Framework for Narrowing the Achievement Gaps  The achievement gap, a persistent disparity in educational outcomes between different groups, poses a significant challenge to educational equity. While various factors contribute to this issue, parental involvement has been identified as a crucial factor in mitigating its effects. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) offers a valuable framework for understanding how parental involvement can influence academic performance and potentially bridge the achievement gap.  TPB suggests that behavior is driven by the intention to perform a specific action, which in turn depends on three key elements: attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Attitude refers to the positive or negative feelings towards the action, while subjective norms represent the perceived pressure to engage in the behavior from significant others. Perceived behavioral control reflects the belief in one's ability to successfully perform the action.  Applying TPB to parental involvement in education suggests that parents' intention to be involved is influenced by their attitude towards involvement, their perception of societal expectations and school support for involvement, and their confidence in their ability to effectively engage with their children's education. By understanding these motivational factors, we can tailor interventions to strengthen parental involvement and improve academic outcomes for under-represented students.  Several strategies can be employed
## Towards Dialogue Management for Restricted Domain Question Answering Systems  Current question-answering systems often struggle with open-ended dialogue, failing to handle user confusion, irrelevant input, and conversational drifts.

Techniques like **topic tracking** and **intent recognition** allow the system to understand the overall flow of the conversation and respond appropriately. Additionally, **contextual awareness** empowers the system to tailor its responses based on the specific information available in the conversation history.  **Effective dialogue management for restricted domain systems involves:**  * **Context-sensitive response generation:** Providing relevant and concise answers based on the current conversation context. * **Error correction and clarification:** Identifying and correcting user errors, and proactively clarifying ambiguous input. * **Conversation flow control:** Guiding the conversation towards relevant topics and ensuring logical progression. * **User feedback collection:** Gathering user feedback to improve the system's understanding of the domain and refine its dialogue management capabilities.  **Benefits of implementing dialogue management in restricted domain systems include:**  * **Improved user experience:** More engaging and productive
## BabelNet: Building a Very Large Multilingual Semantic Network  BabelNet is a massive multilingual semantic network encompassing over 116 languages. This remarkable resource tackles the challenge of representing word meaning across languages, facilitating cross-lingual communication and understanding. At its core lies the idea that word meaning can be decomposed into smaller units called "lexemes," which are then linked to concepts in a network.  The BabelNet project utilizes various data sources, including Wikipedia, WordNet, and numerous bilingual dictionaries. These sources are analyzed to extract linguistic information, including word translations, synonyms, and semantic relationships. This information is then used to build the BabelNet graph, where nodes represent concepts and edges represent relationships between them.  The construction of BabelNet involves a meticulous process of identifying and linking related words across languages. This is achieved through:  * **Word sense disambiguation:** Determining the precise meaning of words in different contexts. * **Cross-lingual linking:** Finding corresponding words or concepts in other languages based on their meaning and context. * **Multilingual compositionality:** Understanding how words combine to form phrases and sentences.

## Effective Inference for Generative Neural Parsing  Generative neural parsing models have emerged as powerful tools for syntactic analysis, leveraging the expressive power of deep learning to capture complex grammatical relationships. However, efficient inference remains a critical challenge, as these models can be computationally expensive. To achieve practical applications, effective inference techniques are essential.  **Challenges in Generative Neural Parsing:**  Generative parsing models rely on complex inference algorithms that search for the most likely parse tree from the learned representation. This search process can be computationally expensive, especially for large and complex sentences. The inherent probabilistic nature of these models further adds to the complexity, as the model must consider the probability of each possible parse tree.  **Effective Inference Techniques:**  To address these challenges, researchers have explored various effective inference techniques for generative neural parsing models. These include:  * **Beam search:** Limits the search space by selecting a limited number of candidate parse trees during inference. * **Dynamic programming:** Exploits the structure of the sentence to cache partial results and reduce redundant computations. * **Approximate inference:** Uses heuristics or approximations to reduce the computational complexity of the inference process. * **Stochastic inference:** Samples from the posterior distribution of possible parse trees, allowing for efficient inference of complex structures.  **Factors
## Privacy Preserving Big Data Mining: Association Rule Hiding Using Fuzzy Logic Approach  Privacy concerns arise when analyzing sensitive big data, as individual privacy can be compromised through association rule mining.

## Natural Policy Gradient Methods with Parameter-based Exploration for Control Tasks  Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) methods have emerged as powerful tools for learning control policies in reinforcement learning. These methods leverage the natural gradient of the policy, which points in the direction of the optimal policy, to iteratively update the policy parameters. However, traditional NPG methods often struggle with exploration, as they rely on stochastic policy updates that can lead to sub-optimal behavior.  To address this, researchers have proposed parameter-based exploration techniques. These methods augment the NPG update with additional exploration noise drawn from a parameterized distribution. The parameterization allows for control over the exploration process, enabling the agent to balance exploration and exploitation effectively.  **How it works:**  - NPG methods track the natural gradient of the policy, which points towards the direction of the optimal policy. - Parameter-based exploration adds a noise term to the NPG update, drawn from a distribution parameterized by a set of hyperparameters. - These hyperparameters control the amount and type of exploration introduced.  **Advantages of NPG with Parameter-based Exploration:**  - **Improved exploration:** Provides more targeted and efficient exploration compared to traditional methods. - **Reduced overfitting:** The parameterization allows for better control
## Automatic Ranking of Swear Words Using Word Embeddings and Pseudo-Relevance Feedback  Swear words pose a significant challenge in various applications, including content filtering, sentiment analysis, and language translation. Automatically ranking swear words based on their offensiveness or impact is crucial for these tasks. While traditional approaches often rely on manually curated lists or rule-based systems, these can be inefficient and fail to capture the nuanced meanings of words.  Word embedding models offer a promising solution for automatically ranking swear words. These models represent words as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space, capturing semantic relationships and contextual information. By leveraging word embeddings, we can capture the semantic similarity between swear words and other words in the context of a given document or conversation.  **Pseudo-relevance feedback** is a technique that exploits the inherent ambiguity of natural language to automatically generate relevance feedback. By presenting users with ranked lists of words and asking them to confirm or reject the ranking, we can gather implicit feedback on the relevance of the words. This feedback can be used to refine the word embedding models and improve the accuracy of the ranking algorithm.  **Here's how the process works:**  1. **Word embedding generation:** Train word embedding models on a large corpus of text data. 2. **Ranking

To overcome these limitations, novel approaches based on local binary patterns (LBPs) have emerged. LBPs capture local texture information by comparing pixel intensities within a small neighborhood around each pixel. However, using only LBPs at a single scale can be insufficient for robust face recognition.  **Multi-scale block LBPs (MSBLBPs)** address this by considering multiple scales of local neighborhoods.

To achieve wider operational bands, modifications to the loop geometry or feeding network are required. One promising approach is the utilization of split-ring resonators (SRRs), which exhibit multiple resonant modes offering wider impedance bandwidth. However, conventional SRRs have limitations in terms of their quality factor and mode coupling, hindering their application in multimode antenna designs.  This paper proposes a novel multimode and wideband printed loop antenna based on degraded split-ring resonators. By degrading the SRRs, their quality factor is intentionally lowered, leading to the excitation of multiple resonant modes within the operating frequency range. This deliberate degradation enhances the impedance bandwidth and facilitates multimode operation.  **Key features of the proposed antenna:**  * **Multimode operation:** Multiple resonant modes contribute to the antenna's impedance response, resulting in wider operational bandwidth. * **Wideband:** The antenna exhibits significantly improved impedance matching across a broad frequency range, covering multiple cellular and Wi-Fi bands. * **Printed loop design:** The antenna is fabricated using a simple printed loop structure, simplifying fabrication and integration into various devices.
## From Brexit to Trump: Social Media’s Role in Democracy  The rise of social media has fundamentally reshaped democratic landscapes across the globe. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have become vital tools for citizen engagement, information dissemination, and political mobilization. However, recent events like the Brexit referendum in the UK and the US presidential election in 2016 have brought into sharp focus the potential for social media to undermine democratic processes.  **Brexit and the echo chamber effect:**  The Brexit campaign extensively utilized social media, particularly Facebook groups and targeted advertising.

## An Adaptive Version of the Boost by Majority Algorithm  The Boost by Majority (BMa) algorithm is a popular ensemble learning algorithm known for its effectiveness in classification and regression tasks. However, its performance can be limited when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where some classes are significantly under-represented compared to others. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive version of the BMa algorithm that dynamically adjusts its weighting scheme based on the data distribution encountered during training.  **Adaptive Weighting Scheme:**  Our adaptive weighting scheme involves tracking the proportion of votes each class receives during the boosting process. If a class receives a proportion below a predefined threshold, its weight in the subsequent iterations is increased. Conversely, if a class receives a proportion above the threshold, its weight is decreased. This ensures that the algorithm focuses more attention on the under-represented classes, leading to improved classification accuracy.  **Algorithm Flow:**  1. **Initialization:** Assign equal weights to all classes. 2. **Boosting:** Repeat the following steps:     - Train a base classifier using the current weighted data.     - Calculate the class proportions from the predictions of the base classifier.     - Update the weights based on the class proportions, increasing weights of under-represented classes and decreasing

Traditional approaches often struggle with variations in handwriting styles, pressure, speed, and individual quirks. Fuzzy logic offers a powerful tool to tackle this problem by handling imprecision and uncertainty inherent in handwriting features.  **Fuzzy Logic Framework:**  Fuzzy logic employs linguistic variables with associated degrees of truth to represent imprecise concepts like "similar" or "different." This allows for representing handwriting features with varying degrees of certainty, rather than crisp true/false values.   **Feature Extraction:**  The process begins by extracting features from the handwriting samples. Common features include stroke length, width, curvature, and angularity. These features are then fuzzified using linguistic variables like "short," "medium," "long," "thin," "thick," "smooth," "jagged," etc.  **Rule-Based Inference:**  The extracted features are used as input to a set of fuzzy rules. These rules express relationships between features and character identities. For example, "If stroke length is medium and width is thin, then the character is likely 'A'."   **Defuzzification and Recognition:**  The outputs of the fuzzy rules are defuzzified

## Training Faster by Separating Modes of Variation in Batch-normalized Models  Batch normalization (BN) has become a vital technique in deep learning to improve training stability and convergence. However, its inherent stochasticity introduces mode collapse, where different training modes coalesce into a single, less diverse mode during training. This can lead to stagnation and slow convergence, especially in large models with many parameters.  **Separating modes of variation** offers a promising solution to this problem. By strategically separating the modes of variation within the batch, training becomes less susceptible to mode collapse. This allows for faster exploration of the parameter space and escaping local optima.  **How it works:**  - Traditional BN uses a single moving average to track the batch statistics (mean and variance) during training. This average represents a compromise between the current batch and previous updates, leading to mode collapse. - By introducing multiple independent moving averages, each tracking a different mode of the batch distribution, the approach avoids the averaging process that homogenizes the modes. - Each independent moving average is updated with a subset of the batch, selected based on their distance to the center of the batch. This ensures that different modes are updated with different statistics, preventing them from converging to a single mode.  **Benefits of separating

## Risk Taking Under the Influence: A Fuzzy-Trace Theory of Emotion in Adolescence  Adolescence is a period characterized by heightened emotional reactivity and risk-taking behavior. This interplay can lead to dangerous situations, such as substance abuse, reckless driving, or unsafe sexual practices. Understanding the emotional underpinnings of adolescent risk-taking under the influence of substances requires a nuanced theoretical framework.  The Fuzzy-Trace Theory of Emotion (FTTE) offers such a framework. FTTE argues that emotional experiences are encoded in memory as "fuzzy traces," characterized by ambiguity, partial retrieval, and blending with other memories. This ambiguity allows for flexible recombination of memories, leading to emotional reactivity and behavioral flexibility.  When adolescents engage in risky behavior under the influence of substances, their emotional state is likely characterized by heightened activation and impaired control. This heightened activation can lead to the "contamination" of memory traces, blurring the lines between safe and risky situations. The impaired control further contributes to the difficulty in discriminating between appropriate and inappropriate actions.  FTTE suggests that the emotional ambiguity associated with fuzzy traces allows adolescents to readily associate positive emotions with risky behaviors, leading to repetition. The presence of substances enhances this association by disrupting the normal encoding and consolidation processes of memories. This disruption results in weaker boundaries between positive

## Record-Aware Two-Level Compression for Big Textual Data Analysis Acceleration  Analyzing massive textual datasets is a computationally expensive process, often requiring significant storage and processing power. Traditional compression techniques are often ineffective for textual data due to its inherent sparsity and redundancy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel **record-aware two-level compression** approach specifically designed for accelerating big textual data analysis.  **Two-Level Compression Architecture:**  Our approach consists of two levels of compression:  * **First Level:** Field-aware dictionary compression. This level utilizes a field-aware dictionary to replace commonly occurring words with shorter tokens. This reduces the overall data size without significant loss of information. * **Second Level:** Run-length encoding. This level exploits the inherent run lengths of repetitive characters within tokens to further reduce the data size.  **Record-Awareness:**  Traditional compression algorithms are oblivious to the underlying records in the dataset. This can lead to suboptimal compression when records contain different lengths or densities of repetitive characters. Our approach is **record-aware**, meaning it takes the record structure of the dataset into account. This allows for more effective identification and compression of repetitive patterns within records, leading to better overall compression.  **Acceleration for Big Data Analysis:**
## Spatial Cloaking for Anonymous Location-Based Services in Mobile Peer-to-Peer Environments  Location-based services (LBS) are an integral part of modern mobile devices, enabling features like location-aware recommendations, geosocial networking, and emergency services.

## Exclusivity-Consistency Regularized Multi-view Subspace Clustering  Multi-view clustering deals with the problem of clustering data points based on multiple, possibly noisy, views or projections. While traditional clustering algorithms often struggle with such scenarios, subspace clustering offers a promising solution by identifying clusters that are consistent across different views.   However, a fundamental challenge in multi-view subspace clustering is balancing two conflicting goals: exclusivity and consistency. Exclusivity demands that points within a cluster be far from other clusters, while consistency requires that the identified clusters be similar across different views.   To address this, exclusivity-consistency regularized multi-view subspace clustering algorithms have been proposed. These algorithms incorporate two regularization terms into the clustering objective function:  **1. Exclusivity Regularization:** - Penalizes the overlap between clusters across different views. - Ensures that clusters are visually disjoint in each view.  **2. Consistency Regularization:** - Enforces that clusters identified in different views share similar characteristics. - Ensures that clusters are consistent across views in terms of their subspace representation.  These algorithms typically employ alternating optimization strategies to update cluster assignments and subspace representations alternately. By iteratively optimizing both components, these algorithms achieve a balance between exclusivity and consistency, leading to more

## Weakly Supervised Semantic Image Segmentation with Self-Correcting Networks  Weakly supervised learning tackles the challenge of limited training annotations, which plagues traditional image segmentation tasks. Existing approaches often rely on complex priors or heuristics to compensate for the lack of labels. This paper proposes a novel framework, Self-Correcting Networks (SCNs), for weakly supervised semantic image segmentation.  **SCNs leverage two key ideas:**  * **Self-supervised learning:** An initial segmentation is generated from the image itself, using techniques like geodesic distance or spectral clustering. * **Self-correction:** The initial segmentation is used to refine the model's understanding of the image, leading to a more accurate segmentation in subsequent iterations.  **The proposed framework consists of three stages:**  1. **Initial Segmentation:** This stage utilizes readily available image features like edges, textures, or color statistics to generate an initial segmentation mask. 2. **Self-Learning:** The model learns from the discrepancies between the predicted and ground truth segmentation masks generated in previous iterations. This feedback loop helps the model refine its segmentation capabilities. 3. **Final Segmentation:** The network converges with accurate segmentation results after multiple iterations of self-learning.  **SCNs offer several advantages over existing weakly supervised methods:**
## Personality Consistency in Dogs: A Meta-Analysis  Understanding canine personality is crucial for effective communication and responsible ownership. Research suggests consistency in personality traits across contexts and over time, indicating that dogs possess stable personalities. This consistency has been explored through meta-analyses, comprehensive statistical analyses of multiple studies.  Meta-analyses have confirmed significant consistency in core personality traits like boldness, neuroticism, and extraversion in dogs.

## Learning Semantic Similarity  Learning semantic similarity is a crucial aspect of natural language processing and artificial intelligence. The ability to understand the meaning of words and sentences allows machines to communicate effectively, interpret context, and generate human-like responses. This process involves discovering the relationships between words and concepts, identifying synonyms, and recognizing different nuances of meaning.  **Traditional Approaches**  Traditional methods for learning semantic similarity relied on hand-crafted features and linguistic knowledge. These approaches often involved counting the number of times words appear together in documents or calculating the distance between words in a semantic space. While effective, these methods can be laborious and require domain expertise.  **Embeddings**  Modern approaches to semantic similarity leverage word embeddings, which represent words as numerical vectors. These vectors capture semantic relationships between words, allowing for efficient computation of similarity. Popular embedding models include Word2Vec, GloVe, and ELMo. These models learn word representations from large amounts of text data, capturing semantic relationships through word co-occurrence and contextual information.  **Learning from Context**  Contextual learning methods further enhance semantic similarity. These approaches consider the surrounding words and sentences to understand the true meaning of words.

## What Action Causes This? Towards Naive Physical Action-Effect Prediction  Understanding the relationship between actions and their subsequent effects is a fundamental aspect of human cognition. We effortlessly predict how our actions will impact the world around us, guiding our actions and ensuring smooth interaction with the environment. This ability, known as **action-effect prediction**, is surprisingly complex and nuanced, despite appearing effortless.  Traditional models of action-effect prediction rely on sophisticated computational processes involving extensive knowledge about the world and physics. However, these models can be computationally expensive and struggle to generalize to novel situations. To achieve efficient and flexible action-effect prediction, a more **naive** approach is proposed.  This naive approach focuses on identifying the **causal relationships** between actions and their consequences through **visual observation and physical interaction**. By witnessing an action causing a specific effect in the environment, the brain forms a mental representation of the action-effect pair. This representation is then used to predict the outcome of future actions based on their similarity to previously observed actions.  The key feature of this naive approach is its reliance on **direct experience** and **sensory feedback**. By interacting with the environment and observing the results, the brain can rapidly learn and refine its understanding of action-effect relationships. This enables efficient action planning
## Towards 3D Face Recognition in the Real: A Registration-Free Approach Using Fine-Grained Matching of 3D Keypoint Descriptors  Traditional face recognition methods rely on 2D images, neglecting valuable depth information available in 3D scans. While 3D face recognition offers greater accuracy and robustness, it often requires explicit registration of the facial models to account for variations in pose, illumination, and expression. This registration process can be cumbersome and computationally expensive.  This paper proposes a novel registration-free approach for 3D face recognition based on fine-grained matching of 3D keypoint descriptors. Our method avoids the need for explicit model registration by focusing on identifying homologous points across faces based on their local geometric features.  **Key Features:**  * **Fine-Grained Matching:** Instead of matching entire facial regions, we extract fine-grained keypoints from 3D scans, capturing subtle variations in facial landmarks like pores, wrinkles, and fine features. * **Descriptor Normalization:** To account for variations in pose and illumination, we normalize keypoint descriptors using robust statistical techniques. * **Matching Algorithm:** We employ a nearest neighbor search algorithm with geometric hashing for efficient and accurate matching of keypoints across faces.  **Proposed Pipeline:**
## Deep Recurrent Models with Fast-Forward Connections for Neural Machine Translation  Traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been widely used in neural machine translation (NMT), but suffer from vanishing and exploding gradient problems. To address these limitations, deep recurrent models with fast-forward connections have been proposed.  **Deep RNNs:**  Deep RNNs utilize multiple stacked layers of RNN cells to capture long-term dependencies in sequences. This hierarchical structure allows them to learn long-term dependencies by composing shorter-term dependencies learned in lower layers with longer-term dependencies learned in higher layers.  **Fast-Forward Connections:**  Fast-forward connections bypass the hidden state of previous layers and directly connect the output of lower layers to the input of higher layers. This allows information from earlier parts of the sequence to be transferred more efficiently to later parts, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.  **Benefits of Fast-Forward Connections:**  - **Improved Long-Term Memory:** By directly accessing information from earlier layers, fast-forward connections effectively expand the effective memory capacity of the model. - **Reduced Vanishing Gradient:** The direct flow of information reduces the exponential decay of gradients, preventing information from vanishing in deeper layers. - **Faster Training:** Faster convergence and reduced training time due

## Statistical Syntax-Directed Translation with Extended Domain of Locality  Statistical Syntax-Directed Translation (SSDT) models leverage both statistical and syntax-based approaches to translation. They combine the strengths of both methods, offering improved accuracy and fluency compared to purely statistical or rule-based models.   **Domain of Locality**  Traditional statistical translation models suffer from the "domain of locality" problem. They struggle to generalize from specific contexts in the training data to unseen contexts in the test data. This limits their ability to translate accurately, especially for complex sentences or those involving domain-specific terminology.  **Extended Domain of Locality**  To address this issue, researchers have developed **Extended Domain of Locality (EDL)** models. These models expand the context window beyond the sentence level, considering additional information from the surrounding text. This allows them to capture broader semantic and syntactic patterns, leading to improved generalization and translation quality.  **Statistical Syntax-Directed Translation with EDL**  SSDT models with EDL incorporate syntax information extracted from the training data to guide translation. This syntax information is used to:  * Improve word alignment between source and target languages, especially in complex sentences. * Identify and translate domain-specific terms and concepts more accurately. * Generate more fluent and grammatical
## Plane Detection in Point Cloud Data  Plane detection is a crucial step in many applications involving point cloud data, such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and 3D mapping. The ability to accurately detect planes allows for understanding the underlying structure of the environment and interacting with it effectively.   **Algorithms for plane detection in point cloud data primarily rely on two approaches:**  **1. Model-based approaches:**  * These methods assume a specific parametric model for a plane, such as a plane equation or normal vector. * They search for clusters of points that fit the model, using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Iterative Closest Point (ICP). * This approach is efficient but may fail to detect non-planar surfaces or planes with outliers.   **2. Model-free approaches:**  * These methods do not require any prior knowledge of the plane model. * They identify planes by analyzing local neighborhoods of points, often using clustering algorithms. * This approach is more robust to outliers and can detect arbitrary plane orientations, but is computationally more expensive.   **Common algorithms for plane detection in point cloud data include:**  * **RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)**: randomly selects points and fits a plane to them, rejecting outliers based
## Improving Naive Bayes Classifier Using Conditional Probabilities  The Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) is a fundamental classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. While it performs well in certain scenarios, it suffers from limitations due to its simplifying assumptions, leading to poor performance in complex situations. One way to enhance its effectiveness is by incorporating conditional probabilities.  **Understanding the Limitations of NBC:**  The Naive Bayes Classifier makes two key assumptions:  * **Feature independence:** It assumes that the presence of one feature is independent of the presence of any other feature. * **Class conditional independence:** It assumes that the probability of a feature belonging to a class is independent of the values of other features.  These assumptions are often unrealistic in real-world applications, leading to biased and inaccurate classifications.  **Introducing Conditional Probabilities:**  Conditional probabilities address the limitations of NBC by capturing the dependence between features and classes. They represent the probability of a feature belonging to a class, given the values of other features. This information can be used to:  * **Reduce feature independence:** By incorporating conditional probabilities, the classifier can learn how the presence of one feature affects the probability of another feature belonging to a class. * **Address class conditional dependence:** It can capture situations where the probability of a feature

## Neural Correlates of Heart Rate Variability During Emotion  Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of the adaptability of heart rate to changing circumstances, is influenced by emotional states. Positive emotions generally lead to increased HRV, reflecting enhanced parasympathetic activity, while negative emotions often result in decreased HRV, indicating heightened sympathetic activation. The neural systems underlying these emotional influences on HRV are complex and involve various brain regions.  **Amygdala:** This almond-shaped structure in the temporal lobe is crucial for processing emotional information, including fear and pleasure. The amygdala sends signals to the hypothalamus, influencing cardiovascular responses through the release of neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine.  **Hypothalamus:** This region regulates various physiological processes, including heart rate. It receives input from the amygdala and other brain regions involved in emotional processing, and uses this information to modulate HRV. The hypothalamus can directly stimulate or inhibit the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.  **Prefrontal cortex:** This region is involved in higher-level emotional processing, including the regulation of negative emotions. The prefrontal cortex communicates with the amygdala and hypothalamus, helping to control the emotional influence on HRV.

By identifying key factors influencing success, educators can tailor interventions and support to better cater to individual student needs.  **How do decision trees work?**  The process starts with gathering relevant data about students, such as demographics, academic history, test scores, and engagement metrics. This data is then used to build a decision tree. The tree's branches represent different criteria, and the leaves represent the final outcomes (e.g., high, medium, or low academic success). The algorithm splits the data based on the most informative criteria, maximizing the information gain at each node.  **Factors influencing academic success:**  Decision trees have identified various factors that contribute to academic success. These include:  * **Academic factors:** Previous grades, standardized test scores, study habits, homework completion rate. * **Socio-economic factors:** Family income, parental education, access to technology. * **Psychological factors:** Motivation, self-confidence, learning styles. * **Engagement factors:** Class attendance, participation in extracurricular activities, interaction with teachers.  **Applications of decision
## Normalizing SMS: Are Two Metaphors Better than One?  Messaging systems like SMS rely on metaphors to represent their functionality. These metaphors shape user expectations and interactions. While the traditional "letter-in-a-bottle" metaphor adequately describes sending a private message, it doesn't capture the inherent limitations of the platform. Introducing a second metaphor, "instantaneous conversation," better reflects the real-time nature of SMS communication. However, the question arises: is using two metaphors simultaneously better than sticking to one?  Using both metaphors simultaneously enhances user understanding. The "letter-in-a-bottle" metaphor clarifies the individual, private nature of a message, while the "instantaneous conversation" metaphor emphasizes the real-time nature of the platform. This duality helps users understand the unique characteristics of SMS: it's a private channel, but one that facilitates immediate exchange of information.  However, employing multiple metaphors can also create cognitive overload. Users may find themselves grappling with conflicting or redundant concepts. This ambiguity can lead to confusion and misinterpretations of the platform's functionality. Additionally, relying on two metaphors can complicate the design of interfaces and user experiences.  Therefore, striking a balance is crucial. While highlighting both the private and real-time aspects of SMS
## Hierarchical Complementary Attention Network for Predicting Stock Price Movements with News  Understanding market sentiment is crucial for predicting stock price movements. Traditional methods rely on fundamental analysis or technical analysis, neglecting the vast amount of information contained in news articles. News sentiment analysis offers a valuable opportunity to capture market anticipation and guide investment decisions. However, traditional sentiment analysis models often struggle to capture the nuanced relationships between words, sentences, and paragraphs, leading to inaccurate predictions.  To address this, researchers propose a Hierarchical Complementary Attention Network (HCAN) for predicting stock price movements with news. This innovative model leverages the power of hierarchical attention to capture the complementary relationships between different levels of textual representation.  **Hierarchical Attention:**  - HCAN employs a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures dependencies between words, sentences, and paragraphs. - Attention weights are calculated based on the relevance of words to sentences, and sentences to paragraphs. - This allows HCAN to capture long-range dependencies and represent news articles in a concise and informative manner.  **Complementary Attention:**  - HCAN introduces a complementary attention mechanism that focuses on words that are relevant to both the sentence and the paragraph they belong to. - This ensures that the model captures words that are crucial for both the overall sentiment of the sentence and the
## Creativity in Higher Education: The use of Creative Cognition in Studying Book Sections  Within the realm of higher education, fostering creativity has become increasingly recognized as vital for student success. Traditional learning methods often prioritize analytical and factual understanding, neglecting the immense potential of creative cognition in enriching the learning experience. One area where this potential can be particularly impactful is the study of literature, specifically through the examination of book sections.  Creative cognition involves the deliberate manipulation of knowledge and experiences to generate new and original ideas. It involves processes like brainstorming, mind mapping, and analogical reasoning, all of which can be applied to literary analysis with profound effects. By engaging in creative cognition, students can delve deeper into the complexities of a book section, generating fresh interpretations and gaining a richer understanding of its themes, characters, and literary devices.  One practical application of creative cognition in literary studies is the visualization technique. By visualizing characters, settings, and events in vivid detail, students can immerse themselves in the fictional world created by the author. This immersive experience enhances comprehension and facilitates a deeper connection to the text. Similarly, the technique of character mapping can be used to create detailed profiles of characters, exploring their motivations, relationships, and development throughout the book section.  Furthermore, employing creative cognition can empower students to
## Minimum Description Length Induction, Bayesianism, and Kolmogorov Complexity  Minimum Description Length (MDL) induction is a powerful framework for unsupervised learning and inference, closely connected to both Bayesianism and Kolmogorov Complexity. This approach focuses on finding the simplest explanation for the observed data, where simplicity is measured by the length of the description required to encode the data efficiently.  **Kolmogorov Complexity**  Kolmogorov Complexity (KC) quantifies the information content of a sequence of symbols. It measures the length of the shortest program that can generate the sequence. In essence, it reflects the complexity of the sequence, with lower complexity indicating a more concise description.  **Bayesianism and MDL**  Bayesianism provides a statistical framework for updating beliefs based on evidence. It postulates that the probability of a hypothesis is proportional to the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis. MDL induction aligns with Bayesianism by favoring hypotheses that require a shorter description length to explain the observed evidence. This aligns with the Bayesian principle of selecting the most likely hypothesis.  **Relationship to Unsupervised Learning**  MDL induction is particularly useful for unsupervised learning tasks, where no labeled training data is available. By focusing on finding the simplest description of the data, MDL automatically discovers patterns and structures without explicit guidance. This
## Recipient Revocable Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption: How to Revoke Some Recipients in IBBE without Knowledge of the Plaintext  Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption (IBBE) allows secure communication to a large group of recipients without individually encrypting for each one. However, in certain scenarios, it becomes necessary to selectively revoke the encryption rights of some recipients without compromising the confidentiality of the message. This poses a significant challenge in traditional encryption schemes.  **Recipient Revocation in IBBE:**  Traditional methods for revoking identities in public-key cryptography rely on certificate revocation lists (CRLs) or key escrow techniques. These methods require knowledge of the plaintext or the secret keys of the revoked recipients, which is impractical in IBBE due to the large number of recipients and the decentralized nature of the system.  **Proposed Approach:**  This paper proposes a novel approach for selective revocation in IBBE without compromising the plaintext. The core idea is to leverage **group signatures** and **key renewal protocols**.  **1. Group Signatures:**  - Instead of encrypting for individual identities, the sender generates a group signature using a group key shared only by authorized recipients. - Only those with the correct group key can verify the authenticity of the signature and decrypt the message.  **2
## When 25 Cents is Too Much: An Experiment on Willingness-To-Sell and Willingness-To-Protect Personal Information  The erosion of privacy in the digital age is a pressing concern. Data, once considered private, is now readily collected, analyzed, and monetized by various entities. While individuals understand the potential benefits of data collection, such as personalized services and targeted advertising, concerns linger about the price at which privacy is bought and sold.  This experiment investigates the public's willingness to sell and protect their personal information in exchange for seemingly small financial incentives. Specifically, it examines the threshold at which individuals draw the line, refusing to sacrifice privacy for even modest rewards.  The study employed an online survey platform, reaching a diverse sample of adults across demographics. Participants were presented with various scenarios involving different types of personal information, such as email addresses, phone numbers, browsing history, and medical records. For each scenario, participants were asked to indicate their willingness-to-sell or protect the information for different financial incentives, ranging from 10 cents to 25 cents.

## Functional Connectivity and Brain Architecture  The human brain is a complex network of neurons and synapses that interact in a coordinated fashion to generate thoughts, emotions, and behavior. Functional connectivity measures the statistical dependencies between brain regions, reflecting the extent to which their activity is correlated during rest or task performance. This connectivity pattern is believed to be influenced by the underlying structural connectivity architecture of the brain, which is defined by the physical connections between neurons and brain regions.  Functional linked resting-state networks (RSNs) are groups of brain regions that exhibit reliable and consistent connectivity during rest. These networks are often associated with specific cognitive functions, such as attention, memory, and language processing. The functional connectivity within these networks reflects the underlying structural connectivity, suggesting that the physical connections between neurons constrain and shape functional interactions.  Studies have shown a close correspondence between the architecture of RSNs and the structural connectivity derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). For example, regions that are structurally connected are more likely to be functionally connected at rest. This correlation is particularly strong for long-distance connections, indicating that long-range structural connectivity plays a crucial role in functional connectivity.

## AutoLock: Why Cache Attacks on ARM Are Harder Than You Think  ARM architectures, widely used in embedded systems and mobile devices, are often assumed to be secure against cache attacks. This perception stems from the widely held belief that ARM's innovative memory management features, such as Write-Back Buffer (WBB) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP), effectively mitigate cache-based side-channel attacks. However, recent research suggests that this is not entirely accurate.  **The Cache Attack Challenge**  Cache attacks exploit the inherent parallelism of modern processors by manipulating the cache state to infer sensitive information from seemingly unrelated operations. These attacks work by carefully crafting memory access patterns that leak information through cache hits and misses.  **ARM's Defenses**  ARM's mitigation techniques, such as WBB and DEP, aim to address cache attacks by:  * **WBB:** Allows speculative writes to be cached but ensures only committed writes are reflected in memory, reducing the attacker's ability to infer information from cache behavior. * **DEP:** Prevents data from being executed as code, mitigating the risk of attackers exploiting cache-to-memory data dependencies.  **The Hidden Vulnerability**  Despite these defenses, cache attacks remain possible on ARM due to two key vulnerabilities:

## Control Theoretic Approach to Tracking Radar: First Step Towards Cognition  Tracking radar systems play a crucial role in various applications, including air traffic control, surveillance, and missile defense. Traditional tracking algorithms rely on linear models and Gaussian assumptions, which limit their effectiveness in complex environments with non-linear dynamics and uncertainties. To overcome these limitations, a control theoretic approach to tracking radar has emerged as a promising solution.  The control theoretic approach treats tracking as a control problem, where the radar system acts as a controller to estimate the target's state. This approach considers the non-linear dynamics of the target and the measurement process, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, it can handle situations with multiple targets, maneuvering targets, and cluttered environments.  The first step towards cognition in tracking radar using the control theoretic approach is the identification of relevant variables and their dynamics. This involves analyzing the physical principles of radar operation and understanding the factors that influence target detection and tracking performance.

## A Multitask Objective to Inject Lexical Contrast into Distributional Semantics  Traditional distributional semantic models capture semantic relationships between words based on their co-occurrence statistics in a corpus. While these models have achieved success in various tasks, they often struggle to capture subtle semantic differences between words that are closely related in meaning but differ in their degree of semantic contrast.  To address this issue, we propose a multitask learning approach that injects lexical contrast into distributional semantics. Our approach involves training a model to perform two related tasks: **semantic similarity prediction** and **lexical contrast ranking**.  **Semantic similarity prediction** involves predicting the pairwise similarity between words based on their distributional representations. This task encourages the model to capture general semantic relationships between words.  **Lexical contrast ranking** involves ranking words based on their contrastiveness with respect to a given target word. This task incentivizes the model to learn word representations that capture differences in semantic contrast between words.  By jointly optimizing both tasks, our multitask learning approach effectively injects lexical contrast information into the distributional representations. This allows the model to capture subtle semantic differences between words that traditional models may miss.  **Benefits of our approach:**  * **Improved representation quality:** By explicitly injecting lexical contrast, our model

## Autoencoders, Minimum Description Length and Helmholtz Free Energy  Autoencoders are unsupervised learning algorithms that aim to compress data into a lower-dimensional representation and then reconstruct it back to its original form. This process encourages the model to learn the underlying structure and features of the data. Two key concepts related to autoencoders are **Minimum Description Length (MDL)** and **Helmholtz Free Energy (HFE)**.  **Minimum Description Length (MDL)** measures the information required to encode a dataset efficiently. It penalizes models that require more information to encode the data than necessary. This principle is often used to guide the training of autoencoders. By minimizing the MDL, the model learns a representation that captures the essential features of the data while discarding unnecessary information.  **Helmholtz Free Energy (HFE)** is a measure of the surprise associated with a given model. It quantifies the difference between the probability of the observed data under the model and the probability of the data under the null model (a uniform distribution). HFE can be used to assess the quality of the learned representation. A lower HFE implies that the model can explain the data more efficiently than the null model.  Both MDL and HFE are useful for evaluating the performance of autoencoders.
