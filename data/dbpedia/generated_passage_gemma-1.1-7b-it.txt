## Niagara Falls: A Geological Journey  The Niagara Falls we see today are the culmination of millions of years of geological evolution. Their origins lie in a vast lake that covered much of present-day eastern North America during the Pleistocene epoch, roughly 2 million to 10,000 years ago. This lake, known as Lake Iroquois, was formed by the damming of the Champlain Sea by the advancing continental glaciers.  As the climate warmed and the glaciers retreated around 10,000 years ago, Lake Iroquois began to shrink. The outlet of the lake narrowed, creating a powerful waterfall where the water rushed through. This waterfall was the precursor to the modern Niagara Falls. Over thousands of years, the waterfall eroded the rock, creating the gorge we see today.  The size and configuration of Lake Iroquois played a crucial role in shaping the Niagara Falls we see today. The lake was much larger than the present-day Lake Ontario, and its outlet was located further south, near the current border between New York and Pennsylvania. This configuration caused the water to flow with greater force, eroding the rock more quickly and creating the deep gorge.  The Niagara Falls we see today are actually two waterfalls: the American Falls and the Horseshoe Falls. These falls were
