Spearman correlation should be used instead of Pearson correlation when the data is **non-parametric**, meaning it does not follow a normal distribution or exhibit linearity.   **Rationale:**  * **Pearson correlation** assumes that the data is **normally distributed** and **linearly related**.  * If the data is **non-normally distributed**, the Pearson correlation can be misleading as it can still show a strong correlation even if the data is not linearly related. * **Spearman correlation** is a **non-parametric** measure of correlation that does not make these assumptions. It measures the monotonic relationship between two variables, meaning it can detect whether the data increases or decreases together, regardless of the underlying distribution.  Therefore, Spearman correlation is more appropriate when the data is skewed, has outliers, or exhibits non-linear relationships.

**Rationale:**  The semicolon (;) in a C statement serves as a **statement terminator**. It indicates the end of a complete statement and allows multiple statements to be written on the same line or separated into multiple lines.  **Function:**  - **Separates statements:** Each statement in C must be terminated with a semicolon. This allows multiple statements to be written on the same line, separated by semicolons.   - **Indicates the end of a statement:** The semicolon marks the boundary between one statement and the next. It tells the compiler that the previous statement has ended and allows the next statement to be processed.   - **Line continuation:** A semicolon can also be used to continue a statement onto the next line. This is useful when a statement is too long to fit on a single line. By placing the semicolon at the end of the first line, the programmer can continue the statement on the next line without having to indent it.   **Example:**  ```c int main() {     int a = 10;     int b = 20;     int sum = a + b; // Semicolon terminates the assignment statement     printf("%d\n", sum); // Semicolon terminates the printf statement }

**Rationale:**  Retroviruses are unique among viruses as they carry their genetic material in the form of RNA rather than DNA. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme produced by retroviruses that is responsible for converting the viral RNA genome into a complementary DNA (cDNA) intermediate. This process is crucial for the retroviral life cycle.   **Role of Reverse Transcriptase in Retroviral Infection:**  1. **RNA genome reverse transcription:** Reverse transcriptase binds to the viral RNA genome and synthesizes a complementary DNA strand using the RNA strand as a template.    2. **Integration into host genome:** The cDNA intermediate produced by reverse transcriptase is then integrated into the host genome by the viral integrase enzyme.    3. **Transcription from integrated viral DNA:** The integrated viral DNA becomes a provirus and can serve as a template for transcription, leading to the production of new viral RNA and proteins necessary for subsequent infection.   4. **Genetic variation:** Reverse transcriptase is prone to errors during the DNA synthesis process, introducing random mutations into the viral genome. This genetic variation contributes to the ability of retroviruses to escape host immune responses and evolve new variants.

**Rationale:** Blood clotting is a complex physiological process involving a series of sequential steps to ensure the formation of a stable clot to prevent excessive bleeding and maintain homeostasis. The normal blood clotting process consists of three distinct phases:  **1. Platelet Aggregation:**  - Platelets are the first responders to tissue damage, adhering to the site of injury and forming temporary plugs. - Platelet aggregation is triggered by exposure to collagen fibers at the site of injury. - Platelets release clotting factors, signaling molecules, and fibrinogen.   **2. Coagulation Cascade:**  - A series of biochemical reactions involving clotting factors, fibrinogen, and platelets. - Activation of clotting factors leads to the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin strands. - The fibrin strands form a mesh-like network, entangling platelets and red blood cells to form a stable clot.   **3. Clot Retraction and Dissolution:**  - The clot undergoes contraction and reorganization, strengthening the mesh network. - Platelets and fibrin strands contract, reducing the size of the clot and promoting stability. - Eventually, the clot is dissolved by fibrinolytic enzymes to restore blood flow once the bleeding has been stopped.
**The primary tectonic process responsible for creating the vast canyon system on Mars is subsurface erosion by volcanic and hydrothermal activity.**  **Rationale:**  * **Canyon morphology:** Martian canyons exhibit features such as steep walls, narrow gorges, and branching tributaries, suggesting subsurface erosion rather than erosion by surface water. * **Volcanic and hydrothermal activity:** Mars has a volcanic history, and subsurface hydrothermal systems are known to be associated with volcanic activity. * **Isostatic rebound:** Mars is still undergoing isostatic rebound from past volcanic and tectonic activity, which can reactivate subsurface faults and canyons. * **Mars' current arid environment:** The lack of liquid water on Mars today limits surface erosion, indicating that subsurface processes are the primary drivers of canyon formation. * **Comparison with terrestrial canyons:** Martian canyons share similarities in morphology and formation mechanisms with canyons on Earth formed by volcanic and hydrothermal activity.

**The area enclosed by the hysteresis loop is a measure of energy dissipation.**  **Rationale:**  * **Hysteresis loop:** Represents the magnetization and demagnetization process of a magnetic material. * **Area enclosed:** Represents the net energy absorbed or released during the process. * **Energy dissipation:** The energy lost due to internal friction and other mechanisms during magnetization and demagnetization.  When a magnetic material is magnetized, energy is required to overcome the internal resistance to alignment of the magnetic domains. When the magnetic field is removed, some of this energy is not recoverable, resulting in energy dissipation. The area enclosed by the hysteresis loop quantifies this energy dissipation.

**Rationale:**  In an acute hemolytic reaction, red blood cells (RBCs) are rapidly destroyed by the immune system, leading to intravascular hemolysis. This process involves the activation of complement and other immune mechanisms, resulting in damage to the RBC membrane and subsequent lysis.   **What happens to RBCs in acute hemolytic reaction:**  * **RBC membrane damage:** Antibodies bind to specific antigens on the RBC surface, activating complement and other immune mechanisms. This leads to damage to the RBC membrane, causing leakage of intracellular contents.   * **Intravascular hemolysis:** The damaged RBCs are lysed within the bloodstream, releasing hemoglobin and other cellular components into the plasma.   * **Hemoglobin release:** Hemoglobin is released from the lysed RBCs and binds to complement proteins, forming hemoglobin-complement complexes. These complexes can further activate complement and perpetuate the hemolytic reaction.   * **Hypovolemia:** The destruction of RBCs can lead to a decrease in circulating RBC volume, resulting in hypovolemia.   * **Increased production of bilirubin:** Hemolysis releases hemoglobin into the plasma, which is subsequently broken down by the liver, producing bilirubin.   * **Splenic sequestration:** Some RBCs that escape hemolysis are seques

**Rationale:**  The Earth's rotation around the Sun is not exactly 365 days. It is slightly longer, by about 5 minutes and 20 seconds. This discrepancy results in an extra quarter of a day each calendar year.  **What happens to the extra quarter of a day:**  The extra quarter of a day is not added to the calendar. Instead, it is gradually lost over time due to the fact that the Earth's rotation is slowing down slightly. This is known as **secular acceleration**.  The extra quarter of a day is distributed among the days of the year, with each day gaining a few milliseconds over time. However, this change is so small that it is not noticeable in a human lifetime.  **Mathematical explanation:**  * The Earth's rotation is approximately 365.2422 days. * This is 5 minutes and 20 seconds longer than a year of 365 days. * This difference accumulates over time, resulting in an extra quarter of a day every year.

It involves the separation of dissolved substances from blood using a semipermeable membrane.   **Process of Ultrafiltration in the Kidney:**  **1. Blood Flow:** - Blood enters the kidney through the renal artery. - The renal artery branches into smaller arterioles, which supply blood to the renal corpuscles.   **2. Filtration:** - Inside the renal corpuscle, blood passes through a network of capillaries known as the glomerulus. - The glomerulus has a semipermeable membrane that allows water, ions, and small molecules to pass through while retaining larger molecules like proteins and blood cells.   **3. Hydrostatic Pressure:** - High blood pressure within the glomerular capillaries creates hydrostatic pressure. - This pressure forces water and dissolved substances out of the capillaries and into the Bowman's space.   **4. Osmotic Pressure:** - The presence of dissolved substances in the blood creates osmotic pressure. - The osmotic pressure opposes the hydrostatic pressure, limiting the amount of water that can be forced out of the capillaries.   **5.

**Rationale:**  Kerosene oil rises up in the wick of a lantern due to the capillary action of the wick material. Capillary action is the ability of a liquid to rise or descend in a narrow tube or wick due to the cohesive forces between the liquid molecules and the walls of the tube.  **Process:**  * The wick material in a lantern is usually made of a material with a high surface tension, such as cotton or linen. * Kerosene oil has a relatively high viscosity and surface tension. * When kerosene oil is placed in contact with the wick, the molecules form strong intermolecular forces with the wick material. * These forces pull the kerosene oil molecules up the wick, overcoming the gravitational force.  **Factors influencing the rate of rise:**  * **Surface tension:** Higher surface tension liquids rise up wicks more slowly. * **Viscosity:** More viscous liquids rise up wicks more slowly. * **Wick diameter:** Wider wicks allow for faster rise of liquid. * **Temperature:** Higher temperatures increase the viscosity of kerosene oil, slowing down the rise.  **Conclusion:**  The capillary action of the wick material in a lantern draws kerosene oil up the wick, allowing for the controlled release of the fuel and
**Chemical change:**  Proinsulin undergoes several chemical changes to be converted into mature insulin. These changes are:  **1. Cleavage of the connecting peptide:** - The connecting peptide (31-32) between the A and B chains is cleaved off by a specific protease.   **2. Oxidation of the cysteine residues:** - Four cysteine residues in the A and B chains are oxidized to form disulfide bonds. - These disulfide bonds stabilize the folded structure of the insulin molecule.   **3. Removal of the signal peptide:** - The signal peptide (1-21) at the N-terminus is removed by a signal peptidase.   **Rationale:**  These chemical changes are essential for:  * **Stability:** The disulfide bonds stabilize the insulin molecule and protect it from degradation. * **Folding:** The cleavage of the connecting peptide and the formation of disulfide bonds allow the insulin molecule to fold into its active conformation. * **Activity:** The removal of the signal peptide exposes the active site of the insulin molecule. * **Specificity:** The chemical changes ensure that insulin binds only to its specific receptors.

**Rationale:**  The mantle plume model explains the existence of hot spots through the following mechanisms:  **1. Subduction and Recycling:** - Subduction zones are areas where one tectonic plate sinks beneath another. - The sinking plate releases water and other volatiles into the mantle. - This hydration raises the melting point of the mantle, allowing for the release of molten rock.   **2. Upwelling Mantle Plumes:** - As the subducted plate sinks, it creates a low-pressure zone in the mantle beneath the adjacent plate. - This low-pressure zone drives the rise of mantle plumes. - Mantle plumes are columns of hot, buoyant rock that rise through the mantle.   **3. Magmatic Ascent:** - As mantle plumes rise, they heat and expand the overlying mantle. - This expansion creates a pathway for molten rock to ascend. - The molten rock eventually reaches the surface, forming volcanic hotspots.   **4. Hot Spot Formation:** - When mantle plumes reach the surface, they release a continuous supply of molten rock, resulting in the formation of a volcanic hotspot. - The hotspot remains in a relatively fixed location because the mantle plume is rooted in the subducted plate below.   **5.

**Limit of resolution of the human eye:** Approximately **1.5 micrometers (Œºm)**  **Rationale:**  The limit of resolution of a visual system is the smallest distance between two objects that can be distinguished as separate entities. The resolution limit of the human eye is determined by several factors, including:  * **Wave diffraction:** Light waves spread out as they pass through an aperture (such as the pupil of the eye). This spreading limits the ability to resolve fine details. * **Lens aberrations:** Imperfections in the lens can also blur the image and reduce resolution. * **Neural limitations:** The brain can only resolve details that are larger than the size of the receptor cells on the retina.  The Rayleigh criterion is often used to calculate the limit of resolution of a visual system. According to this criterion, two objects are just barely resolved if the center of one image falls on the edge of the other image. The distance between the two objects at which this occurs is the limit of resolution.  The limit of resolution of the human eye is approximately 1.5 micrometers, which means that two objects that are closer together than this distance will appear as a single, blurred object.
